"""
Vacation calendar. Usage:
1. create Person: me = Person('2019-09-13'). Param is first day of work in Surf in iso format.
2. add spent days: me.add_spent_days(7, '2020-04-16'). How much days, and first day of vacation (or any string at this point really).
3. calculate: me.calculate('2020-12-23'). date in iso format at which you want to know how much you have vacation days.
    returns tuple (how much days, days between date and first day, sum of spent days), so just take first value as result.
